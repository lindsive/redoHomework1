        Hey, folks! 

        Lindsay here; welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the first website I have created as a Web Developer, and am very excited about it.

        <br>

        So, how did I end up here? Well, I’m really into science and technology, and am constantly looking to learn how things work. One day I decided to check out what all of this web development and programming stuff was about, and then boom! Found myself online everyday,learning whatever I could.

        <br>

        I’m currently attending the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp (!), and it is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and am excited to see where this path leads me!
