        Hey, folks! 

        Lindsay here; welcome to my corner of the internet! This is the first website I have created as a Web Developer, and am very excited about it.

        <br>

        So, how did I end up here? Well, I’m really into science and technology, and am constantly looking to learn how things work. One day I decided to check out what all of this web development and programming stuff was about, and then boom! Found myself online everyday,learning whatever I could. 
              
        <br>
        <br>

        I’m currently attending the Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp (!), and it is one of the best decisions I’ve ever made, and am excited to see where this path leads me!

        (While not doing newbie web developer things, I enjoy sketching, reading, and watching make Michael Scott make an utter fool of himself on ”The Office”.)
